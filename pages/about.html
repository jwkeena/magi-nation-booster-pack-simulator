        I am aware of the demand for more sets! Maintaining the site takes time
        and research, and tips are much appreciated. Thousands and thousands of
        packs are opened every day on the site, all for free. The more
        donations, the more packs I will add.
        <br />
        <br />
        Want a specific set, but aren't comfortable donating? That's OK! In that
        case the most helpful thing to do is to gather and
        <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">send me</a> the following three data
        points about the set you'd like added. First, find good photos of the
        front and back of all variations of the pack art. I've had good luck
        with front art at
        <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Base_Set_(TCG)#Gallery"
          >Bulbapedia</a
        >; back art tends to come from eBay listings. Second, watch enough
        YouTube pack openings to determine the exact rarity order (see
        <a href="#rules">Rules</a> below for examples). Third, find the chances
        of holos, secret rares, reverse holos, and any other quirk about the
        set. If I have all that information, it will be easy to add your set.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please do note that I won't add any sets that are currently
        <a href="https://www.ptcgoshop.com/card-packs">being monetized</a>
        by the Pokémon Trading Card Game Online. I'm strictly interested in
        historical preservation, and re-creating the experience of opening these
        packs.

        <h3 class="title">FOUND A BUG?</h3>

        <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">Email me directly</a>
        and I'll add the issue to my backlog. Be sure to include which browser
        and platform you were using, as well as what you were doing when it
        happened. Bonus points if you include a screenshot.

        Many of the features on the simulator, especially in the original
        version, were user requests. Let me know what you'd like to see, and
        I'll see if I can add it.

        Current as of 5/13/2021, from most to least recent:
        <ol reversed>
          <li>
            On mobile in the single pack view, when you shake your phone, next card flips over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed headers and footers from the main page to accommodate banner ads (bear with me).
            Changed background of main page.
            Tinkered with z-index of single pack view so that the navbar obscures it when scrolling.
            Site logo now redirects here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added "new" marker to most recently pulled cards in grid view.
            Marker can be manually removed by zooming in on card (left click) or
            right-clicking on card.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added sticky button controls and delete button for all cards in row
            and grid view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added grid view, which is sortable. Resized cards in row view. Added
            alphabetical sorting and set sorting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added ability to delete packs in row view: flip the pack art, and
            then click the delete button. Switching between row view and single
            pack view retains selected sorting option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single pack view keeps sorting option when switching back from row
            view. Reverse holos display properly in zoom mode.
          </li>
          <li>Easter egg for secret rares.</li>
          <li>Fixed holo links for aquapolis and skyridge.</li>
          <li>
            Fixed bug when switching from row view to list view (cards were
            always the first pack pulled, not necessarily matching the pack
            art). Added random pack option. Fixed missing back of pack art for
            aquapolis and neo destiny. Accounted for H numbered holos in
            aquapolis and skyridge when sorting by card number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed duplicate reverse holo bug in legendary collection; display
            e-card series holo effect in row view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added legendary collection, including reverse holo images collected
            by
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70Y9RiY7zHo9Rj-VS0bhiA"

            >
            (thanks!!).
          </li>
          <li>Added crystal rare odds for aquapolis and skyridge.</li>
          <li>Re-integrated e-card series.</li>
          <li>
            Added zoom for single pack view, confetti burst for holo rare and
            secret rare pulls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved styling for mobile devices. Updated about page for new set
            request submission process.
          </li>
          <li>Pack art can be flipped to view the back side in row view.</li>
          <li>
            Archived <a href="/archive/pages/index.html">old site</a>. Complete
            code revision and ui overhaul for main site.

        <h3 class="title">DUPLICATES</h3>
        Duplicates have been prevented in the simulator, since they aren't meant
        to occur in physical packs. In the original 11 sets, it is possible to
        pull two of the same Pokémon, but not with the identical art or card
        number. In expedition base set, it is possible to pull three of the same
        Pokémon with the same art and card number, but of different rarity
        tiers: holographic, reverse holographic, and regular rare.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is, however, one exception of which I am aware. Duplicates are
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GpiwTuO-vw">frequent</a> and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc9A84i2FRw">idiosyncratic</a>
        in Legendary Collection packs. This has not been implemented in the
        simulator yet.
